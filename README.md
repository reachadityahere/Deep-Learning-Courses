This repository contains my solutions for all courses in the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning]

This repository also contains blank notebooks for each course along with my solutions in the respective directories.
You can replace the filled notebooks with empty ones and run a jupyter server to practise.
All images and codes have been checked for compilation.

I would strongly recommend paying for the courses on the parent websites.
To download all your programming assignments including all files and notebooks, follow these steps:

1 - Go to the root tree folder for instance: https://hub.coursera-notebooks.org/user/${user_token}/tree/

2-  Open the terminal by clicking the + button on the right-hand corner

3 - Enter the following command in the terminal: 
    tar cvfzh allassignments.tar.gz *

4 - The previous command will create a zip named allassignments containing all your programmings assignment

5 - Select allassignments.tar.gz and download.
